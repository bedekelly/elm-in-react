# React-Elm

Example configuration of a project:
1. Bootstrapped using Create-React-App
2. Ejected
3. Configured to compile Elm apps
4. Including Elm apps as a React component

This uses [my fork of react-elm-components](https://github.com/bedekelly/react-elm-components), which slightly improves the syntax for including webpack-compiled Elm apps.
